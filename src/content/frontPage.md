#### 7 RANDOM FACTS

- I enjoy soccer, swimming, ice-skating, karting, table tennis, reading and cooking.
- One sport I would like to watch on TV but unlikely to participate in real life is the Dakar Rally.
- I can locate _almost_ all the countries on a world map, but have been to only 3 of them.
- If I can give one piece of advice to the 18-year-old myself, it would be: go to sleep early and wake up early.
- For the purpose of to be able to read Victor Hugo and Guy de Maupassant in the future, I took the French Language course at college. One day I asked my professor why there are "genders" in French vocabulary and he answered, with _frankness_, "I have no idea".
- When I was a kid one of my neighbors was a very intelligent businessman. _20 years later_ I saw him on TV - he became nationally known for a long-time involvement in a lawsuit.
- My primary school and one of the buildings in my college were named after the same person: [Shao Yifu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_Run_Shaw), the Hong Kong entertainment mogul who has donated more than 4 billion HK dollars to education.
