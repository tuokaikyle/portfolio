### INTRODUCTION

- My name is Kai Tuo, (Chinese: 拓开), from [Yulin, Shaanxi province of China](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Yulin,+Shaanxi,+China/@38.2914886,109.6686154,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x360d52a0f444d31d:0x477b748e46e2367b!8m2!3d38.28539!4d109.734589).
- I [didn't] start coding when I was 7.
- My Bachelors was in English Literature, and I went into financing after graduated from college in 2015.
- I left the bank in 2017 and joined a startup company that creates analytics apps for Instagram and facebook.
- My role in the startup company was marketing specialist. But sometimes I do some freelancing in front-end development as well.
- It was during that time that I started to learn coding by myself and wanted to change my career by having a master's degree.
- I came to Australia and started doing the Master of Information Technology at UQ in 2018. I completed it in 2020.
