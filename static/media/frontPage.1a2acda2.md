Hi, I'm Kai. I am a developer programmer, web developer and an AWS certified solutions architect.

- I like to use _React_, Next, Node and Tailwindcss in most of my web projects.
- _Go_ Programming Language sits pretty top in my learning list.
- I am proactively exploring other trending technologies like Serverless, GraphQL, Kubernetes and CDK.
